A key part of this was making partitions, something that I recently 
learned from my probability class. We created two partitions of the 
commands. One set of mov/non-mov commands and another set of 
register/memory commands. We obtain the set of register related 
instructions by adding together the instructions from (including 
mov/non-mov): 

non-mov instructions with two register operands
register-to-register unconditional movs
register-to-register conditional movs
We get the set of memory related non-mov instructions by: 
Subtracting "non-mov instructions with two register operands" from 
"non-mov instructions with two operands" giving us the non-mov 
instructions that employ memory operands. 

Finally, we subtract the above two values from the set of total 
instructions to get the number of memory related mov instructions. 

We then mutliply the number of commands in the memory partition by 
three and the commands in the register partition by 1. Adding them 
together gives us the number of cycles. Dividing by the clock-speed of
 the respective CPU gives us the time it takes.

> About how many times faster for the blocked-matmul program on the 16-register processor? If the program would take half the time write something like 2.0. If it would take twice the time write something like 0.50. Write your estimate to at least two significant figures.
Answer: 1.02

=time for blocked-matmul-with-8-regs/blocked-matmul = 
1.99482472/1.959560521 = 1.0179959738 seconds

(all values are pre-converted to time)
Interesting, blocked-matmul is slower on the 16-register processor.

=time for queens-with-8-regs/queens = 0.07530794/0.078392242 = 
0.96065552 seconds

(all values are already converted to time)
