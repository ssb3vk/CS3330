For this problem I calculated the number of instructions that were in 
each of the buckets 0-32 bits, 32-48 bits, and 48-64 bits by 
subtracting the larger category from the smaller category: 

instructions to construct a 0-32-bit signed value: 
instructions with non-zero immediate that fits in 32 bit (or smaller) 
signed number

instructions to construct a 32-48-bit signed value
instructions with non-zero immediate that fits in 48 bit (or smaller) 
signed number - instructions with non-zero immediate that fits in 32 
bit (or smaller) signed number

instructions to construct a 48-64-bit signed value
instructions with non-zero immediate - instructions with non-zero 
immediate that fits in 48 bit (or smaller) signed number

I then multiplied each subtraction by the respective increase in 
issued instructions, 1, 3, 4, summed them all together, added the 
total number of issued instructions, and divided by the total number 
of issued instructions to get my answer. 

gcc-queens example:
(1 * 87550930 + 3 * 2888265 + 4 * 3117364 + 273560229) / 273560229 = 
1.341996201

I then multiplied each subtraction by the respective increase in 
recorded instructions, 1, 3, 4, summed them all together, added the 
total number of recorded instructions, and divided by the total number
 of recorded instructions to get my answer. 

gcc-queens example:
(1 * 1732440 + 3 * 19999 + 4 * 16544 + 4950904) / 4950904 = 
1.375408814

For example, it would contain twice the instructions, write 2.00. If it would execute half the instructions, write 0.500. Include at least three significant figures in your estimate.
